// A soldier wants to buy w bananas in the shop. He has to pay k dollars for the first banana, 2k dollars for the second one and so on (in other words, he has to pay i·k dollars for the i-th banana).

// He has n dollars. How many dollars does he have to borrow from his friend soldier to buy w bananas?

// Input
// The first line contains three positive integers k, n, w (1  ≤  k, w  ≤  1000, 0 ≤ n ≤ 109), the cost of the first banana, initial number of dollars the soldier has and number of bananas he wants.

// Output
// Output one integer — the amount of dollars that the soldier must borrow from his friend. If he doesn't have to borrow money, output 0.

// Examples
// Input
// 3 17 4
// Output
// 13
