// An elephant decided to visit his friend. It turned out that the elephant's house is located at point 0 and his friend's house is located at point x(x > 0) of the coordinate line. In one step the elephant can move 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 positions forward. Determine, what is the minimum number of steps he need to make in order to get to his friend's house.

// Input
// The first line of the input contains an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1 000 000) — The coordinate of the friend's house.

// Output
// Print the minimum number of steps that elephant needs to make to get from point 0 to point x.

// Examples
// Input
// 5
// Output
// 1
// Input
// 12
// Output
// 3
